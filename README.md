PzzApp is a simple [15-puzzle game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle) written in Cocoa as our first (and only) program in this language. It is far from being finished but usable. It's also quite pointless in itself.

### Setup ###

You'll need a working installation of XCode and MacOSX >= 10.6. Open the project file, set the base SDK to whatever you have and build.

Use at your own risk. Your computer may freeze due to boredom.
